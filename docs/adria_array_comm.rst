AdriaArray Workshops
-------------------------------------

ORFEUS and EPOS (via the EPOS SP project, Task 4.3) have supported the organisation of AdriaArray (AdA) workshops since 2020.


* A first international multidisciplinary workshop was organised in Sopron, Hungary, in May 2020, but it had to be cancelled due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; the `workshop <http://static.seismo.ethz.ch/ccauzzi/orfeus_2020/>`_ was re-organised virtually in November 2020.

* Three virtual workshops were organised in `May 2021 <https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/E6lOqTeMQkiksuT>`_, `November 2021 <https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/uQp1GCjXPCjhkMc>`_ (joint session of the ORFEUS Annual Workshop and the AlpArray Science Meeting), `May 2022 <https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/rf7bcU8bkp4OXmd>`_ (splinter meeting at EGU, Vienna) focused on the establishment of the AdA seismic network and seismological component of the initiative.

* A second international workshop was organised in Potsdam, Germany, on 6-7 October 2022. The program is available here (https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/oylgapO5vuKW9zu) and most oral and poster presentations are available here (https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/IrAUN9bplQeCPLC).  The workshop was attended in person by about 80 people (https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/sZLAY66z7nvjoRp) including 20-25 EPOS SP sponsored participants, while nearly 100 colleagues registered for online participation (https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/uhfkiaZbtdWAVa6). The workshop included an extended demo of the EPOS data portal and a round table discussion on the ongoing and future synergies among AdriaArray, EPOS & ORFEUS. The recently prepared white paper on “AdriaArray: Revealing Earth Structure, Geodynamics and Causes of Geohazards in the Central Mediterranean” was presented in the plenary session and in the parallel session on AdriaArray communication and outreach. The workshop was organised by ORFEUS with financial support from EPOS SP and local support by GFZ. The workshop was an excellent opportunity to: (a) strengthen the relationships among the AdriaArray community members now that field work in the region has finally started; (b) promote, present and discuss the portfolio of EPOS services to scientists & data providers in the AdriaArray region.


* A third international workshop is being organised in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on 3-5 April 2023. The participation will be limited to 120 people due to capacity and safety reasons. Precedence will be given to key AdA and ORFEUS community members.
