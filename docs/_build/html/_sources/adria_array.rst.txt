AdriaArray
==========

The thematic focus of the AdriaArray Project (herein after AdA) is the understanding of
the active deformation of the Adriatic plate and its surroundings. AdA is an international
initiative to foster collaborative research, capacity and community building, with a focus
on the geodynamic processes and the associated geohazards. The AdriaArray initiative will
further foster the scientific exchange and cooperation especially of early career
scientists.

AdA officially started on 19 May 2022 with the establishment of the Steering Committee for
AdriaArray Seismology, coordinated by Prof. Thomas Meier. The Committee approved the
`Memorandum of Collaboration (MoC) <https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/zOhxUOEPwnyA2mp>`_ to be signed by the AdA members.

The current members of the Steering Committee are:
