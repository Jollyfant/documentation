Focus Section on European Seismic Networks and Associated Services and Products (SRL)
=====================================================================================

ORFEUS promoted a Focus Section (FS) of Seismological Research Letters (SRL) on “*European Seismic Networks and Associated Services and Products*”. The FS is published as part of SSRL Volume 92(3): https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/srl/issue/92/3. 
An overview of the contents is given in the “Preface” by Cauzzi et al.

We encourage you to look first at the many interesting papers submitted by the seismic networks and observatories that constitute the core of observational seismology in the Euro-Mediterranean region.

Please also note the coordination papers on the “European Integrated Data Archive” by Strollo et al., and on the “European Strong-Motion Services” by Lanzano et al. And do not miss the discussion on “Large Data in Seismology” by Quinteros et al.

The whole list of papers included in the Focus Section is pasted below. Enjoy the reading!
