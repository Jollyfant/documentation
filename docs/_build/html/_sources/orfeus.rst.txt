ORFEUS information
================================================


The ORFEUS website contains general information on the ORFEUS organization and its initiatives (e.g. EIDA). A subsection of the webpage is dedicated to the ORFEUS Data Center and its specific services.

Founded in 1987, ORFEUS is the non-profit foundation that aims at coordinating and promoting digital, broadband seismology in the European-Mediterranean area. ORFEUS is funded and governed by Corporate Founders from 16 European countries forming the Board of Directors.

ORFEUS coordinates the archiving of, and access to, earthquake waveform data from seismic stations in the European Mediterranean region through European Integrated Data Archive (EIDA) in Europe. EIDA was founded in 2013 and currently comprises 11 nodes, including the ORFEUS Data Center (ODC). ODC is the regional data center in Europe for networks that are not associated with another (national) EIDA node, and is hosted by the seismological division of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) in The Netherlands.

ORFEUS coordinated several EC-funded research infrastructure projects, like  NERIES (Network of Research Infrastructures for European Seismology) and its successor  NERA (Network of European Research Infrastructures for Earthquake Risk Assessment and Mitigation). ORFEUS is one of the most advanced infrastrucures for seismology in Europe and is the infrastructure for seismological waveform data in EPOS (European Plate Observing System) to establish sustainable and harmonized Seismology Services that provide access to and interaction with seismological data, products, and tools (services) on a European level.

On an international level ORFEUS participates in the International  Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN). ORFEUS operates under the auspices of the  European Seismological Commission and cooperates closely with its sister organization in Europe, the  European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC).
