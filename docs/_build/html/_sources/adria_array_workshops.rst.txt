AdriaArray Workshops
====================

ORFEUS and EPOS (via the EPOS SP project, Task 4.3) have supported the organisation of AdriaArray (AdA) workshops since 2020.


* A first international multidisciplinary workshop was organised in Sopron, Hungary, in May 2020, but it had to be cancelled due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; the `workshop <http://static.seismo.ethz.ch/ccauzzi/orfeus_2020/>`_ was re-organised virtually in November 2020.

* Three virtual workshops were organised in `May 2021 <https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/E6lOqTeMQkiksuT>`_, `November 2021 <https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/uQp1GCjXPCjhkMc>`_ (joint session of the ORFEUS Annual Workshop and the AlpArray Science Meeting), `May 2022 <https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/rf7bcU8bkp4OXmd>`_ (spomter meeting at EGU, Vienna) focused on the establishment of the AdA seismic network and seismological component of the initiative.

* A second international workshop in presently being organised in Potsdam, Germany, on 6-7 October 2022. The participation is limited to 100 people due to capacity and safety reasons. Precedence is given to key AdA and ORFEUS community members.
