StationBook
===========

The aim of the European Station Book portal is to set up a unique and reliable international registry of broadband and strong motion stations. Such a registry serves the accelerometric data community, seismological community and (earthquake) engineers. The information can range from generic information, (e.g. coordinates, site names and a full mathematical description of the acquisition equipment), to site specific information like morphology velocity profiles.
