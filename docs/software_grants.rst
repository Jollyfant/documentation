ORFEUS Software Development Grants
==================================

ORFEUS established a Software Development Fund in 2021. 
A Call for Applications opens every spring. Software grants are awarded for the development, consolidation, implementation of relevant software to ease the management of, access to, and processing of data and metadata integrated in the ORFEUS EIDA (European Integrated Data Archive) and Strong-Motion programs. This also includes: processing tools tailored to new quality metrics;  software libraries that can be used centrally as well as by external clients; software useful to prepare the ORFEUS infrastructure to deal with new data types and communities.

The recipients of the *2021* ORFEUS Software Development Grants are as follows:

* **Gesa Petersen (GFZ)** - project “*Extension and implementation of AutoStatsQ for an updating assessment of the quality of seismic data and metadata of seismic networks*”
* **Peter Makus (GFZ)** - project “*Pythonic Global Lithospheric Imaging using Earthquake Recordings (PyGLImER)*”
* **Mathijs Koymans (KNMI)** - “*Integration of Continuous Terrestrial Gravimetric Data from the NEWTON-g Gravity Imager with ORFEUS/EIDA*".

Within one year of the grant start (01.06.2021) the projects will be finalised, and presented to the ORFEUS community on the earliest occasion.

The recipients of the *2022* ORFEUS Software Development Grants are as follows:
