Also, I would like to inform you that we have been actively working on the program, that is presently structured as follows.
On day 1, we plan to have only plenary sessions (with invited talks and discussion) on the following broad topics:

- ORFEUS activities and relevant EC Projects
- AdriaArray (AdA) overview and interdisciplinary science topics
- Seismological challenges with focus on the AdriaArray region

On day 2, only parallel sessions will take place, focused on AdriaArray, ORFEUS, or of common interest.
Among the topics proposed are:

- Ada: Comparing and interpreting observables with the Geophysical Model Generator

Keep enjoying the summertime, see you soon!
