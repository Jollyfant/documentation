Authentication System 
=========================================================

Since March 2019 EIDA put in production the `EIDA Authentication Service (EAS)<https://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/eas/>`, which allows users to get digitally signed tokens to access restricted data.

Complete instructions can be downloaded from the `EAS User documentation<https://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/eas/EIDAAuthenticationService.pdf>`.
