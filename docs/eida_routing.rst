Routing Service
===============

The Routing Service is the service designed to provide users with information about where data can be found for different services.

It serves this information in order to help the development of smart clients and/or services of higher level, which can offer the user an integrated view of the whole EIDA, hiding the complexity of its internal structure.

Full documentation for users and developers can be read from https://routing.readthedocs.io/ .
