Introduction 
================================================

ORFEUS (Observatories & Research Facilities for European Seismology) is the European non-profit foundation that aims at coordinating and promoting digital, broadband seismology in the European-Mediterranean area. ORFEUS, founded in 1987, is funded and governed by Corporate Founders from 16 European countries forming the Board of Directors.

ORFEUS coordinates the archiving of, and access to, earthquake waveform data from seismic stations in the European Mediterranean region through the European Integrated Data Archive (EIDA) in Europe. EIDA was founded in 2013 and currently comprises 11 nodes, including the ORFEUS Data Center (ODC). ODC is the regional data center in Europe for networks that are not associated with another (national) EIDA node, and is hosted by the seismological division of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) in The Netherlands.

ORFEUS coordinated several EC-funded research infrastructure projects, like  NERIES (Network of Research Infrastructures for European Seismology) and its successor  NERA (Network of European Research Infrastructures for Earthquake Risk Assessment and Mitigation). ORFEUS is one of the most advanced research infrastrucures for seismology in Europe and is the infrastructure for seismological waveform data in EPOS (European Plate Observing System).  

ORFEUS develops and deploys sustainable and harmonized, standardized services that provide transparent access to and interaction with seismological data, metadata and products on a European level. On an global level ORFEUS participates in the International  Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN). ORFEUS operates under the auspices of the European Seismological Commission and cooperates closely with its sister organization in Europe, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC).



ORFEUS (Observatories and Research Facilities for European Seismology; https://www.orfeus-eu.org/) is a collaborative non-profit foundation that promotes seismology in the Euro-Mediterranean area through the collection, archival and distribution of digital seismic waveform data, metadata and derived products. ORFEUS is one of the three pillars of the Thematic Core Service for Seismology within the European Plate Observing System (EPOS Seismology). Hence, all ORFEUS services are developed in coordination with EPOS and are EPOS compliant. 

Among the goals of ORFEUS are: 
(a) the development and coordination of waveform data products 
(b) the coordination of a European data distribution system, and the support for seismic networks in archiving and exchanging digital seismic waveform data 
(c) the encouragement of the adoption of best practices for seismic network operation, data quality control and data management 
(d) the promotion of open access to seismic waveform data, products and services for the broader Earth science community. 

These goals are achieved through the development and maintenance of services targeted to a broad community of seismological data users. Two Service Management Committees (SMCs) are established within ORFEUS devoted to managing, operating and developing (with the support of one or more Infrastructure Development Groups): 
(a) the European Integrated waveform Data Archive (EIDA; https://www.orfeus-eu.org/data/eida/)
(b) the European Strong-Motion databases (SM; https://www.orfeus-eu.org/data/strong/). 
The establishment of two additional SMCs is being considered to represent the computational seismology and mobile pools communities within ORFEUS. 

Access to ORFEUS EIDA and SM products is ensured through state-of-the-art information and communications technologies, with strong emphasis on federated web services that considerably improve seamless user access to data gathered and/or distributed by ORFEUS institutions. The web services also facilitate the automation of downstream products. Particular attention is paid to adopting clear data policies and licences, and to acknowledging the crucial role played by data providers / owners, who are part of the ORFEUS community.  

The products and services delivered by ORFEUS are assessed and improved though the technical and scientific feedback of a User Advisory Group, comprised of European Earth scientists with expertise encompassing a broad range of disciplines. This contribution presents the products and services of ORFEUS and introduces the planned key future developments. We welcome community feedback about the ORFEUS strategies aimed at the continuous optimisation of data quality, access, dissemination and use.
